# OnlyInWiggins
Game idea: (This is a prototype of an idea, not yet fully fleshed out. I have put it here to log it for later.)
"Only in Wiggins" is a charicature of the suburban horror genre. The game opens on an engineer driving to an out-of-state conference. Miles away from any big city, their car suddenly starts leaking fuel. They frantically search for a town- any town- along the highway that might have a repair shop. Eventually, they find one a few minutes away in a town called Miggins. Relieved from the worry of being stranded in the middle of nowhere, another one begins to seep in: "Where on Earth am I?" The only establishments you can see (besides the shop) are 24-hour diners, a library, and a daycare. Many townspeople are walking around with white-stained pants and hands, muttering to themselves about something called 'combinatorics'. And if that wasn't enough, the mechanic says repairs will take three whole days! 
Along the way, you will encounter many weird characters; a lady with blackboards outside her house, a parrot who squacks "QED!", "QED!", and a mayor always talking about some relationship group to anyone who'll give him the time. At the end of your involuntary stay, however, you'll come to enjoy the places and people that can only be found in Miggins.
