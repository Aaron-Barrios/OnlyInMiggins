# OnlyInMiggins
Game idea: (This is a prototype of an idea, not yet fully fleshed out. I have put it here to log it for later.)
"Only in Miggins" is a charicature of the suburban horror genre. The game opens on an engineer driving to an out-of-state conference. Miles away from any big city, their car suddenly starts leaking fuel. They frantically search for a nearby town that might have a repair shop, eventually finding one a few minutes away called Miggins. Before the Engineer can fully relax, however, they start to take in their surroundings, and can only think about one thing: "Where on Earth am I?" Besides the shop, the only establishments they can find are 24-hour diners, a library, and a daycare. Townspeople walk around with white-stained pants and hands, muttering to themselves about something called 'combinatorics'. And if that wasn't enough, the mechanic says repairs will take three whole days! 
Along the way, you will encounter many weird characters; a lady with blackboards outside her house, a parrot who squacks "QED!", "QED!", and a mayor always talking about some relationship group to anyone who'll give him the time. At the end of your involuntary stay, however, you'll come to enjoy the places and people that can only be found in Miggins.
